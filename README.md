# LA 2024
This is our team project for LAHacks 2017.

The website is to promote the upcoming 2024 Olympics in Los Angeles to give a better experience for all the tourist
visiting Los Angeles.

The web application basically takes two photos from a user and seamlessly merges the faces from one photo to another
and gives to output image that people can see, comment, and like them.

The website is created using Ruby on Rails with a bunch of HTML, CSS, and javascript and used a python script with opencv, dlib, and numpy library for facial recognition and swapping/merging.
